You need one sim to reach level six first to unlock all the grid items, then any other sim can join, even if they�re level one. To activate fashion hunter, you must first finish the pretty little planters task, then establish 12 stores on the second floor, clean the fourth area, and construct the fashion hunter bargain center. To move an adult sim into town you can either build a new home, or move them into a vacant home. Fashion hunter is a time limited hobby which you can find on the second floor of sunset mall.
