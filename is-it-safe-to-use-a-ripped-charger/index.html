<p>This is more likely when a device is plugged into the charger, however, your device is still pulling power while it’s plugged, meaning there always a chance that it could lead to an electrical fire. Continuing to use this one until the new one arrives, provided you wrap the wires in electrical tape, shouldn�t be an issue. If you can, and especially if the water it fell in wasn’t clean, rinse it well in distilled or at least deionized water before you dry it out. So if you plug a 1a device into a 2a charger, it will still only draw 1a.</p>
