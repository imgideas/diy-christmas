Radish seeds will usually germinate within 10 days, and sometimes as quickly as 3 days, as long as soil temperature and moisture are optimal. Once you have your seeds planted, sprayed with water, and covered with weight, they are now ready to enter the germination period. Radish seed can remain viable for up to 4 years if stored in a cool, dark place. Start radish seeds in the garden about 6 to 4 weeks before you expect the last frost in spring.
