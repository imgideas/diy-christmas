So, for example, super glue is made from something called methacrylate and in the bottle, thatï¿½s fine, but when it comes into contact with water, either in the air or on your fingers, then it starts a chemical reaction which bonds all of the molecules together into big long chains which is what sticks everything together, then the chemical bonds hold everything together.
